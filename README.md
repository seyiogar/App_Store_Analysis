# App_Store_Analysis
INTRODUCTION

The Apple Store, also known as the App Store, is an online marketplace that allows users of Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems to browse and download applications (apps) developed specifically for these platforms.
This project was done using structured query language (SQL) for analysis. 

In this project I explored and analyzed apps in the Apple Store from a vast array of categories, including games, productivity, health and fitness, and many others. The aim of this project is to extract valuable data driven insights about these apps and give recommendations to developers and other professionals to help determine the kind of apps to build.

SOME QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED:

1. Does the price of apps affect the ratings?

2. Does the amount of app languages affect the rating of the app?

3. What app category or genre generate the highest revenue ?

4. Does the app description length affect the app rating?

5. what rating should a new app aim for?

6. What genre of apps have the highest competition?

DATA ANALYSIS:

The data set was then imported into SQL for analysis.

DATA VISUALIZATION:

The data was visualized with Excel.

Conclusions:

1. Paid apps tend to have higher ratings than free apps.

2. Apps that support a between 10 - 30 languages tend to have higher ratings than others.

3. The top revenue-generating app categories are Games, Produtivity, Music, Photo & Video, Education and Health & Fitness.

4. Apps with higher descriptions lengths tend to have higher ratings than other.

5. A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5.
